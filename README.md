# A landing page for a restaurant app
Hi there âœ‹! I made this fully responsive model with React and Sass, I hope you like it, feel free to give me some feedback! It has no Javascript at all, so please dont expect funcionality.
### Some resolution I took thinking of UX
- A searcher (with a magnifying glass, that is a very common and understable symbol)
- A language selector (for no-spanish speakers)
- A list of recommended places: sometimes the user doesn't know exactly what to look for, is always a good idea to suggest some options.
- Photos for the restaurants, visual information is appealing and offers a lot of information about a place.
- Placeholders in the form, in order to ease the comprehension (with a funny but glamorous touch)
